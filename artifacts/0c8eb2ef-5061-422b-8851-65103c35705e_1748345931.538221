The ER diagram you've outlined for the AI-Powered Development Assistant project is well-structured and captures the essential entities and relationships involved in the system. Below, I will provide a detailed overview, including a condensed textual representation and steps for creation.

### Detailed Overview of Entities and Their Attributes:

1. **User**
   - **UserID**: Unique identifier for the user (PK)
   - **Username**: Name chosen by the user
   - **Email**: User's email address
   - **PasswordHash**: Hashed password for authentication
   - **Role**: Role of the user (Admin, User)

2. **Project**
   - **ProjectID**: Unique identifier for the project (PK)
   - **Name**: Name of the project
   - **Version**: Current version of the project
   - **Status**: Current status (e.g., Active, Inactive)
   - **CreatedBy**: ID of the user who created the project (FK)

3. **Artifact**
   - **ArtifactID**: Unique identifier for the artifact (PK)
   - **Name**: Name of the artifact
   - **Type**: Type of the artifact (JSON, Binary)
   - **Version**: Current version of the artifact
   - **Content**: Base64 encoded content of the artifact
   - **CreatedAt**: Timestamp of creation
   - **UpdatedAt**: Timestamp of last update
   - **ProjectID**: ID of the project to which the artifact belongs (FK)

4. **Agent**
   - **AgentID**: Unique identifier for the agent (PK)
   - **Name**: Name of the agent
   - **Type**: Classification of the agent (LLM, Service)
   - **Configuration**: Configuration settings (JSON format)

5. **WebSocket**
   - **ConnectionID**: Unique identifier for the websocket connection (PK)
   - **UserID**: ID of the user associated with this connection (FK)
   - **Status**: Current status of the connection
   - **CreatedAt**: Timestamp of connection establishment

6. **Webhook**
   - **WebhookID**: Unique identifier for the webhook (PK)
   - **URL**: Callback URL for the webhook
   - **EventTypes**: Types of events that trigger the webhook (e.g., Artifact Created, Updated)
   - **Status**: Current status of the webhook
   - **ProjectID**: ID of the project associated with this webhook (FK)

7. **Versioning**
   - **VersionID**: Unique identifier for the version entry (PK)
   - **VersionNumber**: Semantic version number
   - **Date**: Date when this version was created
   - **Changes**: Description of the changes made
   - **ArtifactID**: ID of the artifact this version corresponds to (FK)

### Relationships Summary:

- **User (1) → Project (N)**: A user can create multiple projects.
- **Project (1) → Artifact (N)**: A project can have multiple artifacts.
- **Artifact (M) ↔ Agent (M)**: Artifacts can be interacted with by multiple agents and vice versa.
- **User (1) → WebSocket (N)**: A user can have multiple websocket connections.
- **Project (1) → Webhook (N)**: A project can have multiple webhooks.
- **Artifact (1) → Versioning (N)**: An artifact can have multiple versions.

### Textual Representation of ER Diagram:

```plaintext
[User] 1---* [Project]
  |               |
  |               * 
  |             [Webhook]
  |
  *               1
[WebSocket] ---- [Artifact] 1---* [Versioning]
                * 
               [Agent]
```

### Visualization Instructions:

1. **Select a Tool:**
   - Use diagramming tools such as **Lucidchart**, **draw.io**, or **ERDPlus** to design your ER diagram.
   
2. **Create Boxes for Each Entity:**
   - Draw a rectangle for each entity and label it with the entity name.
   - Inside each box, list down the attributes.

3. **Draw Relationships:**
   - Connect the boxes with lines to represent relationships.
   - Label each line with the nature of the relationship (1:M, M:N).

### Conclusion

This ER diagram provides a solid framework for understanding the data structure necessary for the AI-Powered Development Assistant project. As development progresses, further refinements can be made based on evolving requirements or additional features.
