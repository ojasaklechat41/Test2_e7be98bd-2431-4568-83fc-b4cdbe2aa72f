To create an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram for the `AI-Powered Development Assistant` project, we need to identify the key entities involved and their relationships. Based on the information provided, here is a high-level description of the entities and their relationships that we could include in the ER diagram.

### Entities:

1. **Project** 
   - Attributes: Project ID, Name, Version, Status

2. **Artifact**
   - Attributes: Artifact ID, Name, Type, Version, Content, Created At, Updated At
   - Relationships: 
     - Belongs to a Project (One-to-Many)

3. **User**
   - Attributes: User ID, Username, Email, Password Hash, Role
   - Relationships:
     - Can create/own multiple Projects (One-to-Many)
     - Can manage multiple Artifacts (One-to-Many)

4. **Agent**
   - Attributes: Agent ID, Name, Type, Configuration
   - Relationships:
     - Can interact with multiple Artifacts (Many-to-Many)

5. **WebSocket**
   - Attributes: Connection ID, User ID, Status
   - Relationships:
     - Related to User for real-time updates (One-to-Many)

6. **Webhook**
   - Attributes: Webhook ID, URL, Event Types, Status
   - Relationships:
     - Associated with Project or Artifact (Many-to-One)

7. **Versioning**
   - Attributes: Version ID, Version Number, Date, Changes
   - Relationships:
     - Associated with Artifact (One-to-Many)

### Relationships Summary:

- **Users** can create multiple **Projects** (1:N)
- **Projects** can have multiple **Artifacts** (1:N)
- **Artifacts** can belong to multiple **Agents** (M:N)
- **Users** can have multiple **WebSocket** connections (1:N)
- **Projects** or **Artifacts** can trigger multiple **Webhooks** (1:N)
- Each **Artifact** can have multiple **Versions** (1:N)

### ER Diagram Representation (Textual)

```
[User] 1---* [Project]
[Project] 1---* [Artifact]
[Artifact] *---* [Agent]
[User] 1---* [WebSocket]
[Project] 1---* [Webhook]
[Artifact] 1---* [Versioning]
```

### Conclusion

This high-level ER diagram represents how different components of the `AI-Powered Development Assistant` project interact with each other. You can visualize this diagram using any ER diagram software or tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or even on paper. Each box represents an entity with its attributes inside, and the lines denote the relationships between them. Adjustments can be made based on more specific business rules or data requirements as the project evolves.
