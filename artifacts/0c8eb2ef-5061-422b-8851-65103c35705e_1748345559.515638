     - Type (e.g., JSON, Binary)
     - Version
     - Content (Base64 encoded)
     - CreatedAt
     - UpdatedAt
     - ProjectID (Foreign Key referencing ProjectID)

4. **Agent**
   - Attributes:
     - AgentID (Primary Key)
     - Name
     - Type (e.g., LLM, Service)
     - Configuration (JSON)

5. **WebSocket**

     - EventTypes (e.g., Artifact Created, Updated)
     - Status
     - ProjectID (Foreign Key referencing ProjectID)

7. **Versioning**
   - Attributes:
     - VersionID (Primary Key)
     - VersionNumber
     - Date
     - Changes (Description)
     - ArtifactID (Foreign Key referencing ArtifactID)

### Relationships:

- **User** to **Project**: One-to-Many (A user can create multiple projects)
- **Project** to **Artifact**: One-to-Many (A project can contain multiple artifacts)
- **Artifact** to **Agent**: Many-to-Many (An artifact can be interacted with by multiple agents and vice versa)
- **User** to **WebSocket**: One-to-Many (A user can have multiple websocket connections)
- **Project** to **Webhook**: One-to-Many (A project can have multiple webhooks associated with it)
- **Artifact** to **Versioning**: One-to-Many (An artifact can have multiple versions)

### Textual Representation of ER Diagram:

```
[User] 1---* [Project]
  |               |
  |               * 
  |             [Webhook]
  |
  *               1
[WebSocket] ---- [Artifact] 1---* [Versioning]
                * 
               [Agent]
```

### Visualization Instructions:

To visualize this ER diagram:
1. **Use a Tool:** You can use online diagram tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or ERDPlus to create and visualize the ER diagram. 
2. **Create Boxes for Each Entity:** Create a box for each entity and list the attributes inside.
3. **Draw Relationships:** Use lines to connect related entities, labeling the lines with the type of relationship (1:N, M:N).

### Conclusion

This textual description provides a comprehensive view of the entities and relationships within the `AI-Powered Development Assistant` project. Adjustments can be made as further requirements and details arise during development.
